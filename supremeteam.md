Previously featured on E-Sens and Simon D's own mixtapes, Dok2 (then known as Gonzo Tha Notorious Kid) called up the newly formed Supreme Team to return the favor and deliver guest verses on a track titled [방법Shit (3MC Part.4)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVtN-HlqBd4), off of the then eighteen-year-old rapper's *Thunderground Muzik Mixtape Vol.1* (July 14, 2008) and subsequently, the *I'mma Shine* EP (December 31, 2008).

As a unit, Supreme Team's next guest feature came on labelmate Dynamic Duo's fourth album Last Days, released on August 20, 2008. The track, [Trust Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE3Sw5G7qbw), does not contain a hook and may as well be labeled an Amoeba Culture cypher. With this track, the team was now on their way to breaking out of the underground and going mainstream under Dynamic Duo's label, Amoeba Culture. *Double D, Supreme Team reppin' / Amoeba Culture*

R&B diva Hwayobi featured Supreme Team on the track [우리 사랑해요](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNipwwC0Xg), off of the mini album *This Is Love* (released February 6, 2009), where E-Sens and Simon D further solidified their skills as featured artists, delivering verses over a smooth, harmonica and guitar-based R&B melody. Soon after the release of Hwayobi's mini album, Supreme Team was featured on L.E.O's (formerly Leo Kekoa) album *검은띠* (released February 12, 2009) alongside Clover's Gilme on [청룡열차](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOa4DdlzwA) in addition to being featured on Basement Killer's *Cold War (Be Cruel Mix)* off of *Pull The Trigger* (released February 13, 2009).

Less than a week after Basement Killer's release, Supreme Team found themselves all over Dynamic Duo's *Ballad For Fallen Soul Part 1* (released February 19, 2009). Simon D was featured on the first track, [잔소리](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfhBaGcuFFw), E-Sens was featured on the second track, [L.B.A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Dl5ESDrzw), and together, they were featured on the third track [Beyond The Wall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDhetW3Bmag). With Supreme Team's on-point delivery and Dynamic Duo's unparalleled ability to write hooks, the Team was generating more and more buzz throughout early 2009.

Blue Brand, a large Korean hip hop project, released their first album *12 Doors* on April 15, 2009, which brought Supreme Team alongside other hip hop artists such as Kim Jinpyo, Jandi, Soulman, MC Mong, Navi, Baechigi, Verbal Jint, Koffee, Cho PD, MayBee, Gil of LeeSsang, Crown J, Dok2, Satbyeol, MC Sniper, Miss $, Sol Flower, Jang Geunyi, JOY, Icon, and Red Rock. For their track on *12 Doors*, Supreme Team recorded their first track together, [말 좀 해 줘](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4scFhjT5IQ), featuring Soulman. *What? I wanna get to know you / 진짜로 I wanna get to know you*

##Group Releases

**[2009.07.14] [Supreme Team Guide To Excellent Adventure](http://i.imgur.com/ThNBpVY.jpg)**: The adventure officially begins, as Supreme Team releases their first EP, with features by Beatbox DG, T (Yoon Mirae), Dok2, Dynamic Duo, and DJ Pumkin.

Aside from their individual features on Dynamic Duo's album *Band Of Dynamic Brothers* (released October 7, 2009), Supreme Team did not do as many feature verses as compared to before their EP release. E-Sens was featured on the insane club banger [사우나 (Sauna)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqfi5ZR3soU), while Simon D was featured on the uptempo [월광증 (Moonstruck)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnlq6LGJVVA).

Following their first official release, Supreme Team was enlisted by R&B singer J (also known as J.ae) for her single [Dream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TUc_hA-Eic) (released November 10, 2009). The track would later go on to be popularized on the variety show *Family Outing*. For their debut album *Trouble Makers* (released December 9, 2009), rookie duo Double Trouble got Supreme Team for a feature on the track [거머리](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J8CTMDwsRQ). Supreme Team then made a short appearance on pop soloist Brian (Brian Joo)'s much anticipated second album *Manifold* (released December 10, 2009), in the album's title track [내 여자](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8hCMz3q1yo).

**[2010.03.18] [Supremier](http://i.imgur.com/126shnM.jpg)**: Supreme Team lives up to their name and solidifies their place at the top of the Korean rap game with pretty much an instant classic of an album.

**[2010.09.06] [왜](http://i.imgur.com/FbzDPiV.jpg)**: Together with Brown Eyed Soul's Youngjoon, Supreme Team releases this lounge influenced digital single.

As part of Shin Seunghun's 20th Anniversary album (released November 1, 2010), Supreme Team was selected (alongside Clazziquai, Jungyup, Davichi, 2AM, Navi, Tomtom, ALi, and PSY) to record separate tribute songs, which lead to [로미오 & 줄리엣](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a58QyVcT2g0). To close out Supreme Team's 2010 releases, Lee Kichan then featured the duo on the single [L.O.V.E.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQM8imjLyn4) (released December 2, 2010), off of the drama OST for SBS's *Life Is Beautiful*. To end 2010, Supreme Team recorded part of the [2010 MAMA theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZdH86SOScw) with Narsha and Jea of Brown Eyed Girls, Junsu of 2PM, Boohwal, and 8eight.

Supreme Team kicked off 2011 with yet another drama OST track, this time their own composition [Get Ready](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugw6ecnfUqo) (released January 4, 2011) for SBS's *Athena: Goddess of War*. They then featured on R&B singer Insooni's digital single [어퍼컷](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=venPSxrs5uE) (released February 22, 2011), followed by Kim Sori's digital single [심장이 춤춘다](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-HQqHg-k4g) (released March 4, 2011). Continuing with their mainstream features, Supreme Team joined SISTAR on K.Will's bossa influenced [기가 차](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO8VXP0qmVc) (released March 10, 2011), and they joined LeeSsang's Gil on Jungin's track [철수와 미미](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLsdMMry5HA) off of the mini album *Melody Remedy* (released April 5, 2011).

**[2011.04.15] [Hommage To Quincy Jones](http://i.imgur.com/CFnsuo4.jpg)**: In a collaboration with Dynamic Duo's Gaeko, Supreme Team released this digital single. With a Primary beat, on-point lyricism, and a Gaeko hook, this track showcases the signature Amoeba Culture style.

01. [배가 불렀지](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpO83duj5wQ)
02. 배가 불렀지 (inst.)

Continuing collaborations with their labelmates, Supreme Team, alongside vocalist Mellow and rapper Yankie, laid out crazy verses for Primary's [요지경](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYs9BOfNP4c), a track off of the first in what would become one of the greatest series of singles in recent Korean hip hop–*Primary And The Messengers* (released April 27, 2011).

Despite having been released two years earlier, J.ae's collaboration track with Supreme Team *Dream* (linked earlier) was placed on the soloist's seventh album *Super Star* (released July 1, 2011). This marked the final appearance by Supreme Team together as a duo before their hiatus.

While Simon D promoted his solo releases towards the end of 2011, E-Sens was forced to suspend all recording activities. After pleading guilty to charges of possessing and smoking marijuana, E-Sens was sentenced to a year and two months of prison, with two year probation, along with a two million won fine and hours of required community service and drug addiction rehabilitation. As it was the first offense, E-Sens had the community service and drug rehab removed from his sentence. Furthermore, due to medical and health conditions which affected his lungs, E-Sens would need to go on hiatus and focus on his recovery.

With the release of Primary's *Primary and the Messengers LP* on November 1, 2012, E-Sens announced the end of his personal hiatus by recording the poetic and reflective track [독](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PaDrEAEXDc).

**[2013.03.19] [Thanks 4 The Wait](http://i.imgur.com/xbgMOpx.jpg)**: Following a yearlong hiatus, Supreme Team, finally reunited, made their long awaited return as part of Amoeba Culture's NOWorkend project. Joined by up and coming R&B star and rookie labelmate Crush, who helped compose and arrange the duo's title track in addition to providing vocals for the track's hook. Produced by TK, 이릿 features a bit of trap influence and has been touted as the sequel to 땡땡땡.

##The End Of Supreme Team

As 2013 continued, rumors about Simon D's breakup with Lady Jane arose, claiming that it was due to E-Sens's marijuana scandal. However, both artists denied these rumors. This drama would foreshadow more unfortunate news to come. With Dynamic Duo's seventh album *LUCKYNUMBERS* (released July 2, 2013), Supreme Team made what would be their final guest feature on the track [만루홈런](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpvS76h-yOQ) with DJ Friz. Just over two weeks after the release of Dynamic Duo's album, E-Sens and Amoeba Culture parted ways with a contract termination, and Supreme Team officially disbanded. While the details of the disbandment of Supreme Team remain unclear, Simon D remains an artist under contract with Amoeba Culture, and the two rappers look to continue with their solo careers.

As with all of their previous releases, khiphop enthusiasts eagerly await the next moves by these two phenomenal rappers, but sadly, the "excellent adventure", which began four years ago with the birth of a sensational hip hop duo that brought us some of Korean hip hop's greatest releases, has come to an end.
