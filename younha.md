###Discography & History###

####Debut & First Singles (September 2004-September 2005)####

Prior to her debut, Younha engaged in widespread auditioning in Korea, which, when sadly unsuccessful, prompted her debut in Japan aged 16.^[[5]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2004.09.01]** **[Yubikiri (ゆびきり)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/a/ae/Younha_Yubikiri.jpg)**

Younha's Japanese debut single released with Epic Records under the katakana ユナ (Yuna), one month prior to her official debut as ユンナ (Yunna).^[[6]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) Despite releasing on the Japanese market, *Yubikiri (ゆびきり)* and the accompanying *If* are both sung in Korean. The lyrics were jointly written by Younha and Kim Jungeun, with both songs composed and arranged by Shimizu Tasua.^[[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

3. [If](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8qxvFmJmvQ)
4. If (inst.)

As Younha's first release, the single planted her roots firmly in the pop and rock genres with *Yubikiri*'s solemn verses depicting lost love accompanied by a rhythmic acoustic backer and punctuated by an intermittent electric guitar, whilst the more demure and upbeat *If* featured generally calmer vocal progression: although both tracks reflected a definitive style which would soon become associated with Younha's music. 

The title track *Yubikiri (ゆびきり)* was picked up for the Monday night drama *Tokyo Wankei: Destiny of Love* on Fuji TV after a producer heard Younha's demo tape and was included on the *Tokyo Wankei Greatest Hits* OST, released in August 2004 just prior to the single's first release.^[[7]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) However, the drama received a lacklustre viewership rating of 13.83% and *Yubikiri (ゆびきり)* would fail to place on the Oricon chart.^[[8]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) Younha's official debut with Epic Records as ユンナ (Yunna) would follow in October.^[[9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2004.10.20]** **[Yubikiri -Japanese version- (ゆびきり-日本語version-)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/8/86/Younha_Yubikiri_-Japanese_version-.jpg)**

The Japanese version of *Yubikiri* came bundled with a new track, *Hana no You ni (花のように)* and marked Younha's transition to releasing exclusively in Japanese until her seventh single release, *Ima ga Daisuki (今が大好き)*, in 2006.^[[3]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The lyrics to *Yubikiri -Japanese version-* were rewritten by Ema Sato and both tracks were composed by Teppei Shimizu.^[[9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

4. Hana no You ni (花のように) (inst.)

The second track, *Hana no You ni (花のように)*, was actually a cover of a song of the same name by American duo [Betsy & Chris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_%26_Chris), originally released in 1970.^[[10]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) It represented a slight departure from Younha's other work, with a prominent Hammond organ-style synth accompanying the acoustic guitar and a lighter pop theme to the song as a whole. Overall the single did not garner any significant sales notoriety for Younha, once again unsuccessful in placing on the elusive Oricon chart.

######**[2005.06.01]** **[Houkiboshi (ほうき星; Comet)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/1/1a/Younha_Houkiboshi.jpg)**

Younha's second official single release, *Hōkiboshi* featured the title track *Houkiboshi (ほうき星; Comet)* and two additional b-sides, *Ashita, Tenki ni Nare. (あした、天気になれ。)* and *Omoide ni Dekinai (思い出にできない)*, with lyrics penned by Hisashi Sato.^[[11]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The single was released just under 8 months after the Japanese version of *Yubikiri*.

4. [Houkiboshi (ほうき星; Comet) (inst.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx8ZsgFghuI)

A marked change in Younha's musical style for *Hōkiboshi* came with her first taste of noticeable acclaim. The titular track *Hōkiboshi*, characterised by a high tempo beat & vocals and supported by Younha's own piano instrumental overlaid with a frantic electric guitar riff and ambitious, adventerous lyrics, found mainstream success when it was used as the third ending theme for [*Bleach*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(manga\)#Anime), a popular anime.^[[12]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This tie-in undoubtedly helped to propel Younha into notoriety and, like fellow Korean solo artist BoA, Younha breached the top 20 on the Oricon daily chart: initially placing 18th before peaking in 12th position, gaining the apt nickname "Oricon Comet". Younha also premiered *Hōkiboshi* with a live piano performance on NHK's *Pop Jam* where it achieved the sixth highest approval score ever achieved on the show at 89%.^[[13]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

Continuing Younha's success at landing promotional tie-ins, *Ashita, Tenki ni Nare. (あした、天気になれ。)* was used prior to the single release as the ending theme for TBS's Sunday night reality show *Sekai Ururun Taizaiki* from April to June 2005.^[[14]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The second b-side *Omoide ni Dekinai (思い出にできない)* features the return of the Hammond organ synth with a sombre, regretful balladic track and also found use promotionally as the ending theme for the film *Tenshi ga Orita hi*, released in March.^[[5]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The single peaked in 15th position on the Oricon chart, proving to be a massive success.^[[12]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2005.07.13]** **[Motto Futari de (もっとふたりで)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/b/b2/Motto_Futari_de.jpg)**

Within a decidedly short space of time Younha released her third single, *Motto Futari de (もっとふたりで)*, which finally saw the inclusion of the Japanese version of *If* from her *Yubikiri (ゆびきり)* release one year prior. Still signed to Epic Records, the lyrics to both *Motto Futari de* and *If* were once again written by Hisashi Sato and the single composed and arranged by Naoki Tamura.^[[15]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

>1. [Motto Futari de (もっとふたりで)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obY-TGZRzu4)
2. [If -Japanese version-](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVJMzqqvH0Y)

With *Motto Futari de* and her prior release, *Hōkiboshi*, Younha was experimenting with uplifting, lighter pop tracks whose lyrics revolved around confidence and optimism, less central in her previous releases, with her piano instrumental playing an extensive role in providing momentum to the track. Despite very few promotional activities and no live TV performances, *Motto Futari de* was chosen by NTV as the July 2005 theme for *Uta Star* and featured on the Friday night music performance show *Ongaku Senshi MUSIC FIGHTER* as a Power Play.^[[16]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) 

However, the lack of promotions most likely influenced a modest Oricon charting of #113, charting for just a week and selling less than 2% of the copies of *Hōkiboshi*.^[[17]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) ^[[12]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) Despite this, after the singles release she held several prominent live events including a performance at the Osaka Hoop on the 16th July, and at Tokyo's Laforet Harajuku building on the 17th to an audience in excess of 800 fans.^[[18]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2005.09.07]** **[Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki (タッチ / 夢の続き)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/a/a6/Touch_~_Yume_no_Tsuzuki.jpg)**

Younha's fourth single centred on a cover of the song *Touch* by [Yoshimi Iwasaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshimi_Iwasaki), originally released in 1985, as well as the second A-side track *Yume No Tsuduki*.^[[19]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) *Touch* itself continues Younha's distinctive piano performances in her A-side releases, this time once again supported by a buoyant electric guitar riff and rhythmic bass, with the single featuring a different compositional talent in the form of Hiroaki Serizawa.^[[20]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

3. [Touch (タッチ) (inst.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLaGxw-3QSY)
4. Yume no Tsuzuki (夢の続き) (inst.)

In what was becoming a growing trend for Younha, *Yume no Tsuzuki (夢の続き)* was tied-in with the 2005 live action film remake of [*Touch*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(2005_film\)#Live-action_movie), undoubtedly aiding the singles strong charting position debuting at 14th on the Oricon weekly chart with sales comparable to her earlier success *Hōkiboshi*.^[[21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

####'Go! Younha' & Further Singles (October 2005-November 2006)####

######**[2005.10.05]** **[Go! Younha](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/8/8e/Go!_Younha.jpg)**

As Younha's first album, *Go! Younha*'s tracklist borrows heavily from her earlier singles, but still features an additional six new tracks. As a collection the album provides a mixing pot of poinant balladic numbers such as *Aoi Lemon (碧い檸檬)* and resonant pop rock in *Touch (タッチ)*, intermingled with quirky staccato piano pop such as *Orange no Hatsukoi (オレンジの初恋)*. As the album is universally titled in romanised form it was Younha's first release using her names true pronunciation, as opposed to the approximate ユンナ (Yunna). Lyrics for the new tracks were again provided by Ema Sato, as well as contributions from Satomi, Wada Tsutomu and Okamoto Mayo amongst others with music provided by a variety of composers.^[[22]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

13. [Touch (タッチ)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkmvBJle7J0)

Drawing from the highlights of her past releases and supplementing them with new material, *Go! Younha* is a prime example of her early work whilst still showcasing distinctive experimentation with tracks such as *My Lover (マイ☆ラバ)*; exploring the use of English lyrics in a song which fuses elements of American and European rock with a more identifiable Younha-esque style, while *Aiaigasa (相合傘)* blends a sentimental violin backer with a continuous acoustic guitar piece which drives the song forward. The album released to some commercial success; peaking in 13th position on the Oricon weekly chart and charting for six weeks with sales falling shy of those for *Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki (タッチ / 夢の続き)*.^[[23]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This album would subsequently set a tie-in record in Japan for having official tie-ins for nine of the albums 13 tracks.^[[24]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) 

Younha performed at one major live event in the aftermath of her album release, receiving an invitation to perform at the Harajuku Quest Hall for the Oricon *SoundBlowin'2005* event, with her 30 minute showcase taking place in front of a crowd of 600 alongside distinguished artists such as Japanese rock band [UVERworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uverworld).^[[25]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) 

######**[2005.12.07]** **[My Lover (マイ☆ラバ)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/e/e9/My_Lover.jpg)**

Whilst closely following the moderate success of *Go! Younha*, the independent single release of *My Lover (マイ☆ラバ)* would fail to gain the same traction, peaking at just 58th on the Oricon weekly chart.^[[26]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) 

>1. [My Lover (マイ☆ラバ)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ij5F8qT9og)

3. [Kaerimichi (かえり道)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h91B5OYoFWY)
4. My Lover (マイ☆ラバ) (inst.)

The two new tracks, *Mafuyu no Veil (真冬のVeil)* and *Kaerimichi (かえり道)*, were inkeeping with Younha's established balladic style with the addition of soothing ambient synth in *Mafuyu no Veil*, and of course supported by her own striking piano performances. For the first time since her first release as ユナ (Yuna), Younha wrote the lyrics to *Kaerimichi* entirely herself, and *My Lover* featured as an opening theme for a *Bleach* title for the Nintendo Gamecube, however this tie-in did not bring any significant attention to the release.^[[26]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) 

On the 21st December a [Masayoshi Yamazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Yamazaki) tribute album was released titled *Yamazaki Masayoshi Tribute Album - ONE MORE TIME, ONE MORE TRACK*, for which Younha recorded [**a cover of Boku wa Koko ni Iru**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl5FEQ8oaKU), a popular single originally released in 1998.^[[27]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) ^[[28]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This was subsequently followed by the release of another tribute album, this time for 80s and 90s Japanese pop rock group [PRINCESS PRINCESS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Princess_(band\)) titled *14 Princess ~PRINCESS PRINCESS Children~*, for which Younha recorded [**a cover of the song Diamonds**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBvZln8yKUg).^[[29]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) ^[[30]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This track was Younha's best example of an archetypal rock genre release thus far, and featured heavy bass and electric guitar instrumentals, incorporating elements of funk.

In the interim period before the release of *Te wo Tsunaide (手をつないで)*, Younha performed at her first live event of 2006, appearing at *Rainbow presents Music Garden-春うらら* at the Shibuya Duo Music Exchange on the 20th April, before performing a string of events in May through to June at the Sony Music Anime Festival 2006 in Osaka to crowds of up to 10,000 people; by far her largest yet.^[[31]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2006.06.07]** **[Te wo Tsunaide (手をつないで)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/d/d0/Te_wo_Tsunaide.jpg)**

Continuing a theme which started as far back as *Yubikiri*, *Te wo Tsunaide (手をつないで)* expanded Younha's repertoire of Japanese rock releases with a title track which was dominated by a combination of an energetic drum instrumental and her powerful vocals accented with fierce, ever-present piano and guitar tracks. Younha composed *homegirl* herself, while the other tracks on the release were composed by MO'DOO.^[[32]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) ^[[33]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

3. [homegirl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMOvi38BX-s)
4. Te wo Tsunaide (手をつないで) (inst.)

The second track on the single, *RockStar*, follows a similar fast tempo animato rock style, upheld by a brass backing track, whilst *homegirl* is the sole ballad track and is characterised by a peaceful harmonica melody and wistful vocals. Once again the title track was picked up for an anime, this time as an ending theme to [*Jyu Oh Sei*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyu_Oh_Sei#Anime).^[[33]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) However, like *My Lover* before it *Te wo Tsunaide* launched to a relatively poor Oricon chart performance, reaching just 50th and charting for three weeks.^[[34]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

Younha made her first appearance on Korean television a month after the singles release on the KBS documentary series *Human Theater*.^[[35]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The show documented many of her Japanese activities including her performances at the Sony Music Anime Festival 2006, and unquestionably helped to increase Korean awareness of her career prior to her official debut in the country.^[[36]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2006.09.06]** **[Ima ga Daisuki (今が大好き)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/2/24/Ima_ga_Daisuki.jpg)**

The last in a string of Japanese single releases before Younha's Korean debut, *Ima ga Daisuki (今が大好き)* revolved around Korean and Japanese versions of the title track and the b-side *Inori (祈り; Prayer)*, marking her first Korean language release since the original *Yubikiri* single back in 2004. Watanabe Natsumi contributed lyrics and the release was composed by Naoki Tamura, who previously worked on *Motto Futari de*.^[[37]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

>1. [Ima ga Daisuki (今が大好き; I Love You Now)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VpyciXLpbs)

4. Inori -Korean version- (祈りー韓国語version-)
5. Ima ga Daisuki (今が大好き; I Love You Now) (inst.)
6. Inori (祈り; Prayer) (inst.)

As a title track *Ima ga Daisuki* experimented with a bell chime progression accenting confident lyrics describing yearning for a love and a melodic piano piece, generally speaking of a similar style to past pop releases. Both Korean versions of *Ima ga Daisuki* and *Inori* were picked up as opening and ending themes respectively for the 52-episode Korean anime [*Jang Geum's Dream*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Geum's_Dream), however this tie-in did not significantly raise the singles popularity with it peaking in 71st on the Oricon chart and charting for just two weeks.^[[37]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

On the 18th September, Younha's first Japanese album *Go! Younha* was officially released to Korean streaming sites shortly before her debut with *AUDITION*, which along with her appearance on *Human Theater* marked a distinct focus shift to the Korean market.^[[38]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

####Korean Debut & First Korean Albums (December 2006-February 2008)

######**[2006.12.04]** **[AUDITION](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/9/9d/AUDITION.jpg)**

As Younha's first foray into the Korean market under Stam Entertainment, *AUDITION* returned to a style comparable to that of the high tempo *Hōkiboshi* which originally spelled success for her in the Japan with the A-side *Audition (Time2Rock)*; with lyrics penned by Yisup.^[[39]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The song was promoted heavily on Korean television, debuting on the popular SBS music show [*Inkigayo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Trend) on the 17th December.^[[40]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

3. Audition (Time2Rock) (inst.)
4. [Gidarida (기다리다; Waiting) (inst.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5aVXLEjJs)

The lyrics of *Audition (Time2Rock)* speak plainly about Younha's struggle to enter the Korean scene as a singer, and are set to a quintessential piano rock backer which is lead into by an extended electric guitar riff and slower-paced vocals; whilst *Gidarida (기다리다; Waiting)* is the representative song for Younha's balladic talents and was composed by Younha herself.^[[39]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The single was notably also her first digital release.^[[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

On the 13th December, the title track from Younha's second release, *Hōkiboshi*, was re-released in Japan as part of the compilation album *BLEACH the Best*; featuring alongside other leading Japanese artists including 3 man pop group [SunSet Swish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunSet_Swish) and Japanese rock band [BEAT CRUSADERS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Crusaders).^[[41]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2007.01.17]** **[Hakanaku Tsuyoku (儚く強く)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/a/ae/Hakanaku_Tsuyoku.jpg)**

Younha briefly returned to the Japanese market amidst her Korean debut for this short single featuring a single A-side, *Hakanaku Tsuyoku (儚く強く)* and a B-side, *Aitai (会いたい; I Want to See You)*. Following in the footsteps of her past anime tie-ins, *Hakanaku Tsuyoku* was chosen as the second opening theme for the anime [*Kiba*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiba_(anime\)).^[[42]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

>1. [Hakanaku Tsuyoku (儚く強く)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NCTTHNotOA)

3. Hakanaku Tsuyoku (儚く強く) (inst.)

*Hakanaku Tsuyoku* opens straight into an alternative rock-style affair which somewhat resembles many American and British rock releases in its consistency, whilst the ballad *Aitai* was given definition through its use of a subtle electronic backing beat, not evident in Younha's past releases of this type. The single charted strongly, most likely due to its successful tie-in, placing 36th on the Oricon chart and staying on for two successive weeks.^[[42]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This would subsequently prove to be Younha's last new release of new content with Epic Records.^[[43]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2007.03.15]** **[Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal (고백하기 좋은 날; Good Day for Saying I Love You)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/3/34/A_Perfect_Day_for_Love_Declaration.JPG)**

Two months after the release of her eighth Japanese single *Hakanaku Tsuyoku*, her debut Korean album *Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal (고백하기 좋은 날; Good Day for Saying I Love You)* was released, a pivotal career moment which would soon lead to media recognition of Younha as a participant in the [new Hallyu wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Wave#History).^[[44]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) The album is also notable as being her first release to feature a collaboration in the form of acclaimed Korean R&B singer [Wheesung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheesung), who additionally contributed lyrics for *Bimil Beonho 486 (비밀번호; Password 486)* and their collab track, *Eorin Yokshim (feat. Wheesung) (어린욕심; Childish Selfishness/Young Greed)*.^[[45]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) Additional lyrics were provided once more by Yisup amongst others, with strong compositional expertise from Hwang Chan Hee, and with *Delete* utilising the instrumental talents of Nick Manic, Ziggy & Lindy Robbins.^[[46]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

As with Younha's only prior full album release, the Japanese *Go! Younha*, *Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal* is composed of a variety of genre styles ranging from legato piano pop rock in the main A-side *Password 486* to classy, peppy brass pop in *Hello Beautiful Day*, and the firmly established balladic numbers such as the poignant *Oneul Man (오늘만; Today Only)*. *Childish Selfishness* would prove to set a precedent in Younha's collaboration releases in its experimentation with the hip hop genre, with Wheesung's fast-paced bars interjecting a standard Younha piano rock number.

The album has sold almost 45,000 copies worldwide since release; proving to be a great success as an opener into the Korean market, aided by strong promotion of *Password 486* across the major Korean broadcasting networks around the time of the album launch.^[[47]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) *Password 486* succeeded in winning the SBS *Inkigayo* Mutizen award twice, and was followed closely by a similarly intensive promotion of the second A-side, *Terms of Dating/Love Condition*; which paved the way for her album repackage.^[[48]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

*Note: The exact English names for several songs on this album vary from source to source; here the iTunes names have been used for consistency*

Released just over three months after the original version, the Repackaged *Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal* featured several differences from the standard album; most notably the inclusion of a Korean version of *My★Lover*, originally released as part of the Japanese album *Go! Younha* back in 2005, as well as a remixed version of *Terms of Dating/Love Condition*. Additionally, the instrumental of *I Cry* was dropped in favour of an instrumental version of *Terms of Dating/Love Condition*.

For the Repackage Younha primarily focused on the promotion of *Terms of Dating/Love Condition*, notably appearing at the [StarCraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft) GomTV MSL Grand Finals to perform the song in July.^[[49]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) Whilst the changes to the album as a whole were relatively slight, the Repackage sold an additional 17,000 copies, which, combined with the sales of the original release, made *Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal* Younha's most successful release yet.^[[47]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

Following Wheesung's feature on the *Gobaek Ha Gi Joheun Nal* album, Younha herself featured on Wheesung's fifth studio album, *Eternal Essence of Music*. Released in September, Younha collaborated on the tenth track, **[만져주기 (Soothing Touch)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SczqlY6PPE4)**; a feisty hip hop track which focused on a contrast between Wheesung's own punchy on-beat bars and Younha's soulful interjections and a clear deviation from her usual style.^[[50]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

######**[2007.10.23]** **[Hyeseong (혜성; Comet)](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/d/d5/Comet.jpg)**

As Younha's second major Korean album release, *Hyeseong (혜성; Comet)* served as the Korean release of her *Go! Younha* album released in Japan in 2005 with a few noticeable differences, most obviously the inclusion of a Korean version of *Te wo Tsunaide*, her sixth Japanese single release, and the inclusion of a new ballad titled *Cheonnune (첫눈에; At A Glance)*. The title track, *Hyeseong* - itself a Korean version of *Hōkiboshi* - was used to promote the album.^[[51]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

15. Cheonnune (첫눈에; At A Glance) (inst.)

The album was a moderate sales success, especially considering it largely consisted of translated versions of her Japanese discography, selling almost 40,000 copies since release - figures comparable to her hit singles in Japan.^[[52]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) In accordance with her increasing popularity, on the 17th November, Younha was awarded the *Best New Solo Artist* award at the 2007 MKMF awards.^[[53]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) She also gave an exclusive performance at the event, alongside newly-debuted pop rock band [F.T. Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.T._Island).^[[54]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

A cover of Younha's *Waiting* from her Korean debut *AUDITION*, performed live on radio by popular girl group SNSD's Kim Taeyeon on the 22nd November, provided compelling evidence for Younha's continued rise to fame.^[[55]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) As part of her second collaboration with a Korean artist, on the 29th November one man project band [Toy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_(music_group)) released his 6th studio album *Thank You*, for which Younha collaborated on the 6th track, **[Clear All Day in Seoul Today](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h077K79pBis)**, an emotional, reminiscent rock ballad focusing on lost love.^[[56]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)

####Further Japanese Releases & 'Someday' (March 2008-March 2009)

Younha's first release of 2008 was a repackaged release of her first Korean single *AUDITION*. This version, titled [***AUDITION "The Gift"***](http://www.generasia.com/w/images/5/51/AUDITION_DVD2.jpg) was bundled with a DVD which included a showcase performance of *AUDITION*, and making of MV footage alongside a fan meet recording; with the bundled CD notably lacking the instrumental versions of *AUDITION* or *Gidarida*.^[[57]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references) This run was limited to 10,000 copies.^[[58]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/younha#wiki_references)
