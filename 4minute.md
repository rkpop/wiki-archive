###Group History###
####Conception & Announcement (Early-Mid 2009)####

As with many idol groups, the lineup of 4Minute was initially different from that which they debuted with. Before the youngest member Sohyun was chosen for the group, Kang Ji Hyun (소유) (now a member of Starship Entertainment's girl group Sistar under the stage name Soyou) was initially picked to fill the maknae position in the group^[[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) along with the rest of the official lineup. However it was eventually decided that Soyou's debut would be delayed, and maknae Kwon Sohyun was quickly chosen after a relatively brief period as a trainee to complete the group. Additionally, Gayoon was almost dropped from the group pre-debut as her innocent image wasn't seen to correlate with the groups look.^[[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references)

Kim Hyuna was originally a member of JYP Entertainment's 5 member group Wonder Girls, but her drop out was announced in July 2007 due to poor health.^[[3]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) She transferred to Cube Entertainment at some point in 2008^[[4]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) and was chosen to debut with 4Minute.

**[2009.05.14]** Cube Entertainment officially announced the group's formation and revealed the first members identity - Kim Hyuna. Their debut was also announced for mid-June,^[[5]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) with their name explained by Cube as referring to the "4 minutes" they perform on stage as time to "capture everyone's hearts through each of the members".^[[6]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) The news that Hyuna would debut with the group was met with significant interest, resulting in "4Minute" and "Hyuna" as top search terms across several portal sites including Daum.^[[7]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) Several days later on 21st May, Nam Jihyun was announced as the second member of the group.^[[8]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references)

**[2009.06.11]** The first teaser for their single *Hot Issue* was released in a silhouette style, followed the next day by several official concept photos, finally revealing the other members of the group. Comparisons were drawn between the style of the teaser and the iPod + iTunes advert circulating at the time by some netizens.^[[9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) Meanwhile, seeking to distance the group from perceived rivals such as After School and 2NE1, Cube officially described the groups style as "Candy Funky", elaborating with "they can take the cute, or pure, or strong image, their style changing from time to time",^[[10]](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references) with their first music video release set for 15th June.

####Debut & 'For Muzik' Era ()####

**[2009.06.15]** The music video for *Hot Issue* was officially released. 

**[2009.08.28]** [**For Muzik**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/For_Muzik_1st_Mini-Album.jpg): The groups first mini album, *For Muzik*, was released. It featured a characteristically electronic-heavy style which 4Minute would become known for, and featured heavy involvement from renowned producer and songwriter [Shinsadong Tiger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsadong_Tiger) for the two single releases, *Hot Issue* & *Muzik*, as well as *What a Girl Wants* & *Anjullae*.

1. For Muzik (Intro)
2. Muzik
3. Hot Issue
4. What a Girl Wants
5. Utgyeo/웃겨 (You are a Joke)
6. Anjullae/안줄래 (Won't Give You)
7. Hot Issue (Remix)

The mini albums release quickly followed the Gaon chart success of *Hot Issue* with another single *Muzik*, which peaked in 3rd position and had a large impact for a rookiee group at the time. In general the albums tracks were punchy and to-the-point, differing from other female idol groups of the time in feel and the directness of the lyrics; so much so that broadcaster KBS banned the performance of the song *Anjullae* for allegedly over-sexualised content.^[](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/4minute#wiki_references)

Initially, promotions for the mini album focused on live performances on television music shows including *M Countdown* and *Music Bank*. tbc
