* Don't be mean.

* Piracy is forbidden.

* Do not use URL shorteners.

* Simple questions with only one answer should be asked in /r/kpophelp.

#Help

**My submission isn't appearing!**

Submissions can take a few minutes to appear in the New queue. However, it's also possible that a moderator deemed your post to be spam -- or the automatic filtering program did. If you feel this was a mistake, send a [message to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23kpop).

**How to I get flair next to my name?**

To get an artist or group tagged next to your name, simply click the "(edit)" next to your name, which is towards the top right of the page in the sidebar, from there you should see a drop-down list of all currently available artists to choose from. If the artist you want as flair isn't available, [message the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23kpop)

**What is the "report" button?**

The report button, shown on all links and comments, is a way for the reddit community to send feedback to the moderators that something is spam or otherwise violates the rules -- for example, pornographic content submitted to a non-adult reddit, or a .PDF posted to /r/videos. If your reason for reporting is non-obvious, please leave a reply or send a message to the moderators explaining your reasoning.

You can also report spam by submitting the offending user's overview page to the /r/spam subreddit.

**What happens when something gets reported?**

It will be reviewed, either by a person or a program. The more people who report it, the more likely some action will be taken. Reporting spam is the single most important thing a user can do to help keep reddit clean.
