Note: There can also be some confusion with 'borrowed' English words that are used in Korean, which are not used or pronounced the same way that they are in English. An example is the word 'highlight'; Korean adopted the word to become '하이라이트'/ha-i-ra-i-teu. This is often taken to be extremely bad pronunciation (five syllables) of a relatively simple English word (two syllables), which is *not* the case.

> Examples of English words being used differently in Korean: handeupon (hand phone) = cell phone, pocketball = billiards, gagman = comedian. ^[source](http://kpoppy.com/)

Conceptually, they are allowed/somewhat expected to be more childish, cutesy, and display 'aegyo'. ^[source](http://kpoppy.com/)

The stalker culture among these 'fans' would make the worst paparazzi look like kittens. Sasaengs steal personal information, invade private property, and hire taxis to follow celebrities all day... every day. It's a serious issue that has led to idols being assaulted, groped, threatened, poisoned, and forced into traffic accidents. Some sasaengs have been known to break into dorms and steal personal items as well. ^[source](http://kpoppy.com/)
