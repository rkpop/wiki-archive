#Stale Topics

Introducing something new to /r/kpop. We are introducing the idea of stale topics. Everyone has experienced those type of threads that have been posted over and over again on the subreddit. Honestly, they can be unique at first and will generate discussion. Yet after a period of time, somebody will post the topic again and it gets repetitive. They usually get downvoted and get reported because people are tired of it.

This concept of stale topics might be foreign, but we've seen it in action and work. Thanks to /r/popheads and /r/hiphopheads.

Now, listed below are topics that are banned from discussion. Any posts that are made which are in similar vein will be removed. Perhaps in the future, maybe we'll bring them back. Yet for the time being, they're out of the game.

###Banned Topics

#### Discussions

####Submissions

- Artist music video view count updates (Still permitted are certain music video accomplishments.)

- Artist real-time all kills (Still permitted as submissions are all kills, certified all kills and perfect all kills.)

> Now, the final banned submission topic is artist real-time all kills. For those uninformed and don't know what this is, all kills revolve around a single's performance on Korean music charts. One can track them via [INSTIZ iChart.](http://www.instiz.net/bbs/list.php?id=spage&no=8) The music charts that matter are MelOn, Genie, Mnet, Bugs and Soribada. There are others which are Olleh, Daum, Naver, Monkey3 and Cyworld. But the king of all charts is MelOn.

>* Real-time All Kill is when a song gets #1 on real-time (hourly) charts.
>* All Kill is when a song is #1 on all possible daily music charts.
>* Certified All Kill (INSTIZ) is #1 on all real-time charts and daily charts. (Example: [Suzy and Baekhyun getting a certified all kill](https://i.imgur.com/TEIEeMO.png))
>* Perfect All Kill (INSTIZ) is #1 on all real-time charts, all daily charts and Instiz weekly chart. (Example: [Simon D One, G2, and Bewhy getting a PAK](http://i.imgur.com/w7rLMkb.jpg))

>As you can see, real-time all kills are fairly common and an artist can get them at any time. They frequently occur for new releases due to the initial surge of interest. Once that interest has waned, they will slowly fall off the real-time charts. Source: [Fall Subreddit Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/57vh2m/fall_subreddit_update/)
