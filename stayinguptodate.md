**Staying up to date with Kpop**

Below is /u/kjoneslol 's guide that he wrote a long time ago now. I'm going to keep it and add my own with how I stay up to date. The information in kjoneslol's entry is still relevant and worth a read. 



Kpop is a trendy hobby. What trendy means is that it's constantly changing, evolving and producing new material. As we know turnover is faster than the American industry, so keeping up to date with the latest news regarding our idols can be a bit hard if you're new and haven't been around the industry. 

Here are the basic pieces to how I manage to keep abreast of what's going on. I'll go into detail. 

1. Make a friend that's crazier than you with the SAME bias. 

When I first discovered kpop, there was NO social media. I did forums and I found people that loved BoA just as much as I did or more. They did the hard work for me and I would spazz with them and I'd tell them to tell me the important news relevant to BoA. As I've become older I now keep a few people up-to-date with relevant news to biases we share. I'd really suggest giving back to the community and doing the same once you've become veteran. 

2. Learn to use Facebook news settings. 

A. Before I introduce kpop news portals, It's important to know how to set up lists in facebook. If you don't have facebook it becomes a lot harder to keep relevant with kpop. 
A. On the left side of your facebook, find where it says friends, then click “more”~ [Step One](http://i.imgur.com/ee7puu8.png) 

B. Click the [“Create List”](http://i.imgur.com/6CATEzP.png) button. I have two separate lists, one is Kpop friends (a feed of my kpop friends online) and one are all my kpop related pages I subscribe to. Name your list. I find it really bothersome to add names of pages from the top of my head. So proceed to next step...

C. Click on the left side again and select your Kpop news list. Find where it says [Manage List](http://i.imgur.com/Vm7FbLE.png) then click Edit list. 
D. When the [window](http://i.imgur.com/BaTEzct.png) pops up in the top, click on “pages” and it'll bring up a list of all the pages you subscribe to on facebook. I go through and tick the ones I want on my list. 

E. Then you can go and click on the Kpop news feed on facebook any time and just see kpop news. 

I find browsing titles of articles on facebook enough to satisfy my taste for the latest. Every now and again I'll read an article, but that's rare. 

3. Like kpop portal pages on facebook (and put them in your kpop news feed). 

There are so many kpop portal sites. Since 2008 they've exploded. Some have varying degree of quality. Some cater to certain fans in certain parts of the world. You can get a feel by what they report. I don't rely on one news source because often times spats between companies means they won't report certain things. Take for instance last year allkpop failed to mention KCON, a major North American Event and Concert. I don't want to take my chances so I like a whole lot of pages. Yes, even allkpop. It's poor quality but they are the biggest and they do have exclusives, contests and some live streams I find relevant to my interests. 

The /r/kpop sidebar already has a few portal sites that have facebook presences. In addition, I'll list some that I personally have and use. This is not my complete list. That would take years to write about! Yikes! 

[24/7 Kpop](https://www.facebook.com/247KPOP)

[Asian Junkie](https://www.facebook.com/asianjunkie)

[Hello Kpop](https://www.facebook.com/hellokpop) ~ A more South East Asia focus 

[MTV-k](https://www.facebook.com/mtvkofficial) ~ Slow to posting news, usually like a day behind

[Omonatheydidnt](https://www.facebook.com/OMNTD) 

This is just a small amount. Google Around and try out pages. See what other kpop friends on facebook like. 

4. Like official facebook pages

I'm so happy that Korean Entertainment companies are making official facebook pages. It's like staying directly connected with no middle man. Companies don't always post full schedules, they won't post the scandals nor the little bits on their artists' appearances on variety shows, but they always post MV releases on youtube. When youtube changed their layout I got so mad at the subscriber module that I stopped subbing to channels there. It's so much easier to click the links from facebook. 

I like [Kpoplists](http://kpoplists.com/) to find official facebooks. You can find their list [here](http://kpoplists.com/post/17703247337). In addition there is a twitter list that you can use if you like twitter and staying in touch with idol tweets. This is my personal opinion but I find that news portals report the most important tweets, I don't follow twitter anymore. It because too much. 


5. Browse /r/kpop's hot page. I browse a lot on my phone when I'm outside so I miss a lot of Mvs because I don't want to watch a video on my phone. Everything is posted in /r/kpop so if I feel like I want to watch the newest Mvs, I'll click through the top posts for the day. 


If you ever have any questions, feel free to send me (/u/-momoyome-) a PM and I can always do my best to help.

----
Hi /r/Kpop! ☺ I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while, but never got around to it. However, I felt that it would be a great way to celebrate us reaching 10k members, so here it is! It’s a bit long, so I apologize ahead of time. 

I’ve gotten a few questions over the last few months about how exactly I stay on top of Kpop news and information. I’ve been a fan of Kpop since the 90s, and there never was a time before when information was so easily accessible, yet hard to quickly filter through junk and decipher news. The current sidebar of /r/Kpop has 6 links to how to start listening to Kpop (and recommendations to “starter songs"), but none to continue to find new content and stay on top of the burgeoning industry (outside of "Useful Sites"). Finally, a lot of fans have gotten more secretive about the source of their material, so hopefully this will expand people’s horizons and quench their curiosity. Here’s my list of recommendations, in order of most important to least (the first 3 are the best):

* **Twitter**: There really isn’t a single website that is more influential and important to the spread of Kpop information than Twitter. Sources directly tweet and respond to thousands of people simultaneously. From here, you often hear the fastest news, most recent pictures, and leaks/spoilers to upcoming events/music of your favorite artists. The difficult thing about twitter is that there is no centralized Kpop representative—it’d be way too hard to follow every artist and every piece of news. Instead, there are major “Big Name Fans” in each fandom that corner their own market. It’s important to look for those in your particular interest and follow them if you would like. While I do not claim to know all fandoms, a few good ones off the top of my head are:

>For SNSD: 
>
>* @Real_Chichinhu
>* @ch0sshi
>* @haljung
>
>For Big Bang:
>
>* @LueKim 
>* @hood_bang

Beyond that, there are twitter accounts (examples) associated with almost all major fansites (@sosiznet), fanmade photo sites (@flying_petals), and actual artists (Dara’s new Twitter: @Krungy21). You can add whoever you want depending on your preferences. If redditors know more about their own groups, please share! I’d love to expand my Kpop list on Twitter.

* **Hallyu8/Forums**: Sometimes Twitter is overwhelming. Some fans tweet all day, so news can be lost amidst personal and random information. Forums have always been a great place for K-pop fans to come together. It’s nice because it’s a more distilled form of information that doesn’t disappear if you don’t read it within a certain amount of hours. You can backtrack on your favorite artists after a long day of work or after being away for weeks. Moreover, hundreds—if not thousands—of fans try their best to quickly post new information to notify others. Thus, it helps bring together people of different fandoms and bias groups to post the pictures and news they find. Lastly, it helps fans communicate with each other—both Koreans and Non-Koreans. This is helpful because people vent their frustrations, express their happiness, and are able to read translations/subs of news articles/videos before they’re even released on Allkpop or other congregates (usually hours to days before).

After 6Theory, the major forum site last year associated with Allkpop, “disappeared,” the best forum site now is probably [Hallyu8.com](http://hallyu8.com/). I was more willing to post this guide now because of two reasons: First, [posts like these](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/zyqee/a_proposition_to_the_mods_or_rkpop/) honestly sadden me. No fan should be left wondering what is happening with their favorite group because a major news site decides not to report on them while they’re “on hiatus.” Questions are meant to be asked, and discussions are always great. Second, Hallyu8 just began their “New Members Appreciation Week,” encouraging the community to reach out and invite new people, so I’ve seen a huge spike in new users making it an opportune time for others from here to join if they wanted to. I would check out [this page](http://hallyu8.com/topic/147-artist-thread-directory/) with all the links to artist’s/idol’s threads. Find an artist you are interested, and just take a look around at the content and community. I guarantee that if you are a major fan of a group, you’ll love the threads for the sheer amount of camaraderie and similar enthusiasm. 

Post a 411 so the community can properly welcome you[ here](http://hallyu8.com/forum/4-members-411/), and Say “Hi” in artists threads you are interested in. Fellow fans and members will welcome you with open arms. If you jump in and start posting, you’ll see why forums are a great community for any Kpop fan!

* **Tumblr**: Tumblr is great for sharing new pictures, gifs, and fanmade edits. It hurts itself because there aren’t really that many that discuss Kpop. People like OnionTaker used it as a platform to start a community, but these types of situations are rare. For SNSD, there are some great ones like www.ggoh.tumblr.com who makes new content and answers questions. Find some reputable names in your fandoms. Furthermore, tumblr is great because it has a search tag function. If you replace the #### with a group name or idol you like, you can find all the recent posts tagged with it: www.tumblr.com/tagged/#### This is how I find the most recent gifs for people on Reddit when they ask during a comeback. Put “Secret” in there, and see all the most recent “Poison” gifs made by the community. Put “Hyosung,” and you’ll only find content related to her. Also, this  helps find tumblrs associated with your interested by seeing who submitted those posts.

* **News Aggregates**: There are good news aggregates and bad ones, depending on how they present the news and how nonbias they are. My favorite to visit is probably Koreaboo (by our very own /u/fiveSeven_). Koreaboo (like Soompi, AllKpop, etc) is a news aggregate with information from all areas of Korean Media (not only music). KB is very professional with their wording and timings, without losing their quality. The biggest issues with these sites are that they aren’t always up-to-date with information, sometimes even days to weeks behind when news is actually released, and can’t possibly cover all the information about all your favorite artists. They need to (understandably) choose what is appropriate and post the most important. 

* **Special Sites**: First, [Omona](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/) is a more unfiltered approach to Kpop news. They are a bit quicker and they don’t take themselves as seriously as the sites above. Second, [NetizenBuzz](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/) is run to provide recent reactions from Korean Netizens by directly translating articles and comments. Not all the comments are worthwhile/rational, but they give a good glimpse into how Korea is reacting, instead of only reading international opinions on Reddit or Allkpop. Third, Reddit. We have our own /r/Kpop, which provides barebones news, past throwbacks to MVs/music, and have some discussion. It is generally the most mature Kpop environment I’ve found on the web, simply because it emulates the rest of Reddit/the type of members it attracts. However, because it’s user-driven it might be the sparsest for actual up-to-date information. Also, check out related reddits like /r/Korea and /r/koreanmusic. Lastly, [SeoulBeats](http://seoulbeats.com/) is a great site to read editorials and more lengthy discussions. While the quality has gone done over the years, it nevertheless is the best site for actual written content. I may not agree with everything posted, but they are valid opinions of someone else.

* **Korean Sites**: There are numerous Korean sites that help keep people informed. The obvious Newsen, OSEN, Naver, Daum, etc are good for those who can read and understand Korean, but not everyone can. Moreover, it is hard to translate all those articles and reactions no matter how hard we try. Other sites, like fanmade sites for photos (ShiningSmiles, Seople), often require a KSSN to gain access, but you try to e-mail/tweet them for permission. I can discuss this in another guide in the future.

* **Chatrooms**: Most major communities have a chatroom, but they are often hard to find. Some, for example, are: /r/Kpop has a chatroom (details on the right) and International Sones have a few (/r/snsd, Hallyu8’s ustream room via their Artist Thread, SSF’s Sbox). If someone else knows more, please let us know!

* **Major International Fansites**: I put this last because of how variable it is. Places like [BB World Wide](http://bigbangworldwide.blogspot.com/) do a GREAT job staying on top of breaking news and keeping the community close (I’m almost positive they were the first to report the Sungri scandal hours before anyone else picked up on it recently). Other sites, such as Soshified, have slowly gotten weaker because of the lack of new support. However, they do have a stable forum/gifting portion, and an assortment of past SNSD media/subs. This depends on your fandom and who runs it. Usually the bigger the group, the more fans; the more volunteers/staff, the better sites.


I purposely left out how to access K-Media (Video, Pictures, Subs, Torrents, etc) because I felt that this guide was already too long. I’ll try to write another one up in the future if this first guide is well received or people request it. If not, I can just leave this here for any newcomers, and keep it at that. I know most about SNSD these days, so if fans of other fandoms want to post twitters, tumblrs, chatrooms that would be awesome. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns via comments or PM.
